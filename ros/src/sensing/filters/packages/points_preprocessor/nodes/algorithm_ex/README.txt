Note: this is a modified version of PointsPreprocessor developed by Yoonho Jang.  
Since we have updated to v_1_10, this code needs to be updated to fit the autoware_config_msgs/RingGroundFilter type.
For now, we will just use points_propreprocessor manually and leave this code for reference but not compile it.

There are some interesting points here: handling the different LIDARs, curb detection, etc.
Needs some clean up though.
